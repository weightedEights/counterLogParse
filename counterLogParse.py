"""

The purpose is to read one or more log files, concatenate their data into one new file, and to generate a simple trend
plot (freq vs time).

This script is also an exercise in parsing command line switches. For example, choosing to only concatenate logs without
generating a plot. Or, generating a plot based on one log and not concatenating a range.

Usage:

counterLogParse.py [-h] [-p] [-r] <logFileRangeStart> <logFileRangeStop>

[-h]
    Print this usage
[-p] <logFile>
    Generate plot, requires either log file or..
[-r] <logFile1> <logFile2> <logFile#>
    Concatenate a list of log files into one, new log file. New file can be used as the source data to plot.
